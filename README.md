# JReactive-8583

ISO8583 Java Connector

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kpavlov/jreactive-8583.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kpavlov/jreactive-8583)

## Motivation

1. [jPOS][jpos] library is not free for commercial use. 
2. [j8583][j8583] is free but does not offer network client

Solution: **"J-Reactive-8583"** ISO8583 Client and Server built on top of excellent Netty asynchronous messaging framework with the help of j8583.

For data transmission TCP/IP uses sessions.
Each session is a bi-directional data stream. 
The protocol uses a single TCP/IP session to transfer data between hosts in both directions. 

The continuous TCP/IP data stream is split into frames. 
Each [ISO8583][iso8583] message is sent in a separate frame. 

A Frame consists of a 2-byte length header and a message body. 
The header contains the length of the following message.
The high byte of value is transmitted first, and the low byte of value is transmitted second.

|| 2 bytes          || N bytes
|--------------------|-------------------
| Message Length = N | ISO â€“ 8583 Message

## Supported Features

* Client and Server endpoints.
* Support ISO8583 messages using [j8583][j8583] library.
